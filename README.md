# Git Demo Project

## Description
This is a project to demonstrate the working of git.

# Setup

1. **Initialize a New Git Repository**:
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to create your new Git repository.
   - Run the following command to initialize a new Git repository:
     ```sh
     git init
     ```

2. **Create a README File**:
   - In the root of your new repository, create a README file. You can use any text editor or simply use the command line. For example, you can create a README file using the `echo` command:
     ```sh
     echo "# Project Title" > README.md
     ```
   - Open the README file in your text editor and add some content.

3. **Add and Commit the README File**:
   - Add the README file to the staging area:
     ```sh
     git add README.md
     ```
   - Commit the file to your repository:
     ```sh
     git commit -m "Add initial README file"
     ```

4. **Push to a Remote Repository (Optional)**:
   - If you want to push your repository to a remote server like GitHub, create a new repository on GitHub and then add the remote URL to your local repository:
     ```sh
     git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git
     ```
   - Push your changes to the remote repository:
     ```sh
     git push -u origin master
     ```

By following these steps, you will have successfully initialized a new Git repository and created a clear README file!
